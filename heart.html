            <p class="paraheading"><strong>Abnormal Heart Rhythms</strong></p>
            <p>The heart is an amazing organ. It beats in a steady, even rhythm, about 60 to 100 times each minute.
                That's about 100,000 times each day. Sometimes your heart gets out of rhythm. Your doctor calls an
                irregular or abnormal heartbeat an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia (also called a dysrhythmia) can bring on an
                uneven heartbeat or a heartbeat that is either too slow or too fast.</p>

            <p>The aorta is the large artery that leaves your heart and brings oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your
                body. These two conditions can cause the aorta to widen or tear. This raises the chance of things like:

                About 8 out of every 1,000 children get it. They may have symptoms at birth, but some people with it
                don’t have symptoms until childhood or even adulthood.

                In most cases, we don't know why it happens. Genes may play a role, or it can happen if a baby is
                exposed to viral infections, alcohol, or drugs before it’s born.</p>

            <p>A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops
                to the coronary artery of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is
                chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw. Often it occurs
                in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may
                occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling
                faint, a cold sweat or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often
                present without chest pain and instead have neck pain, arm pain or feel tired. Among those over 75
                years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart
                failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="symppara1">
            <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart diseases include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease</li>
                <li>Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)</li>
                <li>Heart problems you're born with (congenital heart defects)</li>
                <li>Disease of the heart muscle</li>
                <li>Heart valve disease</li>
            </ul>
        
        <br>
        
            <p class="subhead"><strong>Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels</strong></p>
            <p>Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the
                heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary
                artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis).
                Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart
                attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.

                Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely
                to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as
                shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.

                Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include:s</p>

        <div class="symppara3">
            <p class="subhead"><strong>Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias)</strong></p>
            <p>The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
                <li>Dizziness</li>

                <li>Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p class="subhead"><strong>Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects</strong></p>
            <p>Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis)</li>
                <li>Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes</li>
                <li>In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Less-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity</li>
                <li>Easily tiring during exercise or activity</li>
                <li>Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet</li>

        <div class="symppara5">
            <p class="subhead"><strong>Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)</strong></p>
            <p>Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>

            <p class="subhead"><strong>Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease)</strong></p>
            <p>The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse).</p>
            <p>Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain</li>
                <li>Fainting (syncope)</li>
