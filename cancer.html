            <h1>What is cancer</h1>

            <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of
                the body. </p>
            <p>Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally,
                human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body
                needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they
                shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not
                cancerous (benign). </p>
            <p>Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to
                form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors.
                Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.</p>

        <div class="difference">
            <p class="differencehead"><strong>Differences between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells</strong></p>
            <p>Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways. For instance, cancer cells:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals</li>
                <li>ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis).</li>
                <li>invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body. </li>
                <li>tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.  These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.</li>
                <li>hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells. </li>
                <li>trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow. For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.</li>
                <li>accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.</li>
                <li>rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells. In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="typesheading"><strong>Types of Cancer</strong></p>
            <ul><li><strong>Carcinoma:</strong>Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They are formed by epithelial cells, which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body. There are many types of epithelial cells, which often have a column-like shape when viewed under a microscope.

                Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names:
                
                Adenocarcinoma is a cancer that forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus. Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues. Most cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate are adenocarcinomas.
                
                Basal cell carcinoma is a cancer that begins in the lower or basal (base) layer of the epidermis, which is a person’s outer layer of skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Sarcoma:</strong>Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and fibrous tissue (such as tendons and ligaments).

                Osteosarcoma is the most common cancer of bone. The most common types of soft tissue sarcoma are leiomyosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
                
                Our page on soft tissue sarcoma has more information.</li>
                <li><strong>Leukemia:</strong>Cancers that begin in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow are called leukemias. These cancers do not form solid tumors. Instead, large numbers of abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells) build up in the blood and bone marrow, crowding out normal blood cells. The low level of normal blood cells can make it harder for the body to get oxygen to its tissues, control bleeding, or fight infections.  

                    There are four common types of leukemia, which are grouped based on how quickly the disease gets worse (acute or chronic) and on the type of blood cell the cancer starts in (lymphoblastic or myeloid). Acute forms of leukemia grow quickly and chronic forms grow more slowly.
                    
                    Our page on leukemia has more information.</li>

            <p class="symphead"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abnormal periods or pelvic pain-</strong>Most women have the occasional irregular period or cramps. But persistent pain or changes in your cycle can be a sign of cervical, uterine or ovarian cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in bathroom habits-</strong>Significant changes in bodily functions can indicate colon, prostate or bladder cancer, among other cancers. Warning signs include persistent constipation or diarrhea; black or red blood in your stool; black, tarry stools; more frequent urination; and blood in your urine.</li>
                <li><strong>Bloating-</strong>We all feel bloated now and then. But bloating for more than two weeks can be a sign of ovarian cancer, as well as various gastrointestinal cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Breast changes-</strong>These include a new lump, dimpling, discoloring, changes around the nipple or unusual discharge that you didn't have before. Although most breast cancer occurs in women, men can develop it too.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic coughing-</strong>A cough that persists for more than two weeks, especially a dry cough, can be a sign of lung cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic headache-</strong>A headache that lasts more than two weeks and doesn't respond to the usual medications can be caused by a brain tumor.</li>

            <p class="prevhead"><Strong>Preventive Measures</Strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t use tobacco</li>
                <li>Eat a healthy diet</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active</li>
                <li>Protect yourself from the sun</li>
                <li>Get immunized</li>
                <li>Cancer prevention includes protection from certain viral infections like Hepatitis B & Human papilloma virus (HPV)</li>
                <li>Avoid risky behaviour like unsafe sex and sharing needles.</li>
                <li>Get regular self-exams and screenings for various types of cancers — such as cancer of the skin, colon, prostate, cervix and breast. This can increase the chances of discovering cancer early, when treatment is most likely to be successful.</li>
