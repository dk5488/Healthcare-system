    <h1>HIV-AIDS</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS">Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</a> is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the <b>human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</b>. By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.</p>
    <p>HIV is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection#:~:text=Sexually%20transmitted%20infections%20(STIs)%2C,anal%20sex%20and%20oral%20sex.">sexually transmitted infection (STI)</a>. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood and from illicit injection drug use or sharing needles. It can also be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.</p>
    <p>There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but medications can control the infection and prevent progression of the disease. Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world, and international organizations are working to increase the availability of prevention measures and treatment in resource-poor countries.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/symptoms-hiv-infection-infographic_1308-47326.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg" alt="">
    <p><ul>
      <li>For many, yes. Most people have flu-like symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Symptoms may last for a few days or several weeks.</li>
      <li>Having these symptoms alone doesn’t mean you have HIV. Other illnesses can cause similar symptoms.</li>
      <li>Some people have no symptoms at all. The only way to know if you have HIV is to get tested.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Stages of HIV</h2>
    <img src="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/sites/default/files/fact_sheets_data/images/hiv-progression.jpg" alt="">
    <p>When people with HIV don’t get treatment, they typically progress through three stages. But HIV treatment can slow or prevent progression of the disease. With advances in HIV treatment, progression to Stage 3 (AIDS) is less common today than in the early years of HIV.</p>
    <h3>Stage 1-ACUTE HIV INFECTION</h3>
    <p><ul>
      <li>People have a large amount of HIV in their blood and are very contagious.</li>
      <li>Many people have flu-like symptoms.</li>
      <li>If you have flu-like symptoms and think you may have been exposed to HIV, get tested.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <h3>Stage 2-CHRONIC HIV INFECTION</h3>
      <p><ul>
        <li>This stage is also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency.</li>
        <li>HIV is still active and continues to reproduce in the body.</li>
        <li>People may not have any symptoms or get sick during this phase but can transmit HIV</li>
        <li>People who take HIV treatment as prescribed may never move into Stage 3 (AIDS)</li>
        <li>Without HIV treatment, this stage may last a decade or longer, or may progress faster. At the end of this stage, the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) goes up and the person may move into Stage 3 (AIDS).</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Stage 3-Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</h3>
    <p><ul>
      <li>The most severe stage of HIV infection.</li>
      <li>People with AIDS can have a high viral load and may easily transmit HIV to others.</li>
      <li>People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They can get an increasing number of opportunistic infections or other serious illnesses.</li>
      <li>Without HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>How HIV spreads</h2>
    <img src="https://microbiologie-clinique.com/img/hiv-spreads-through.webp?ezimgfmt=rs:636x306/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1" alt="">
    <p>To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><b>By having sex.</b> You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity</li>
      <li><b>By sharing needles.</b>  Sharing contaminated injection drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.</li>
      <li><b>From blood transfusions.</b> In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. Hospitals and blood banks screen the blood supply for HIV, so this risk is very small in the U.S. and other upper-middle-income countries. The risk may be higher in low-income countries that are not able to screen all donated blood.</li>
      <li><b>During pregnancy or delivery or through breastfeeding.</b> Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>

    <p>There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection</p>
    <p>To help prevent the spread of HIV:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><b>Consider preexopsure prophylaxis(prEp)</b>. The combination oral drugs emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy) can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk.<a href="#">Preexopsure prophylaxis(prEp)</a> can reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex.</li>
      <li><b>Use a clean needle.</b>If you use a needle to inject illicit drugs, make sure it's sterile and don't share it. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community. Consider seeking help for your drug use.</li>
      <li><b>If you are pregnant, get medical care right away.</b> If you're HIV-positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can significantly cut your baby's risk.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Treatment</h2>

    <p>HIV disease can be managed by treatment regimens composed of a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARV">antiretroviral drugs(ARV)</a>. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication and allows an individual's immune system recovery to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off opportunistic infections and some cancers</p>
    <p>Some HIV treatments have been combined into a single pill, known as a fixed dose combination, although these often cost more to prescribe.Usually, people who have just been diagnosed with HIV take between 1 and 4 pills a day.Different combinations of HIV medicines work for different people, so the medicine you take will be individual to you.</p>
    <p>The amount of HIV virus in your blood (viral load) is measured to see how well treatment is working. Once it can no longer be measured it's known as undetectable. Most people taking daily HIV treatment reach an undetectable viral load within 6 months of starting treatment.Many of the medicines used to treat HIV can interact with other medicines prescribed by your GP or bought over the counter.These include some nasal sprays and inhalers, herbal remedies like St John's wort, as well as some recreational drugs. Always check with your HIV clinic staff or your GP before taking any other medicines.</p>
