       <h1>COVID-19</h1>
     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
        In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.
        The virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
        The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.

     <h2>Causes</h2>
     <p>Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
     Data has shown that the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters).
     The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks.
     These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.
